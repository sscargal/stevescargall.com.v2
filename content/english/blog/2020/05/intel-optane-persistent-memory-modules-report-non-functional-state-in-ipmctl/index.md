## Issue

Executing `ipmctl show-dimm` to get device information shows the persistent memory modules in a 'Non-functional' health state, eg:

```
# ipmctl show -dimm

 DimmID | Capacity | HealthState    | ActionRequired | LockState | FWVersion
=============================================================================
 0x0001 | 0.0 GiB  | Non-functional | N/A            | N/A       | N/A
 0x0011 | 0.0 GiB  | Non-functional | N/A            | N/A       | N/A
 0x0021 | 0.0 GiB  | Non-functional | N/A            | N/A       | N/A
 0x0101 | 0.0 GiB  | Non-functional | N/A            | N/A       | N/A

 0x1011 | 0.0 GiB  | Non-functional | N/A            | N/A       | N/A
 0x1021 | 0.0 GiB  | Non-functional | N/A            | N/A       | N/A
 0x1101 | 0.0 GiB  | Non-functional | N/A            | N/A       | N/A
 0x1111 | 0.0 GiB  | Non-functional | N/A            | N/A       | N/A
 0x1121 | 0.0 GiB  | Non-functional | N/A            | N/A       | N/A
```

Other `ipmctl` commands may fail and return "No functional DIMMs in the system.", eg:

```
# ipmctl show -sensor health

No functional DIMMs in the system.
```

## Applies To

This issue applies to systems with the following components:

- Linux

- Intel Optane Persistent Memory

- ipmctl utility

## Cause(s)

The ipmctl-show-device(1) man page has the following description for 'Non-functional':

- Non-functional: The DCPMM is present but is non-responsive via the DDRT communication path. It may be possible to communicate with this DCPMM via SMBus for a subset of commands.

**_Note:_** Linux does not support the SMBus interface. It only supports the DDRT protocol (default). Attempts to use the `-smbus` option will fail with the following error:

```
# ipmctl show -smbus -dimm

The following protocol -smbus is unsupported on this OS. Please use -ddrt instead.
```

There are several possible causes for this issue, including:

- The operating system does not support persistent memory. Refer to the [Operating System Support Matrix](https://kb.pmem.io/faq/100000006-Intel-Optane-Persistent-Memory-Operating-System-Support-Matrix/) to confirm compatibility.

- The BIOS does not support NFIT (NVDIMM Firmware Interface Table)

- The nfit and libnvdimm drivers are not loaded in Linux. This can occur when using custom kernels where the drivers have been manually excluded from the kernel config.

## Solution(s)

Here are some troubleshooting steps to verify the working functionality of the persistent memory hardware and operating system.

### Step 1 - Verify the Persistent Memory is seen by the BIOS

Reboot the host and enter the BIOS (usually F1 or F2 during power-on). Navigate to the Memory section and you should see both the DDR and Persistent Memory (DDRT) modules listed, eg:

BIOS -> Advanced -> Memory Configuration showing DIMM Information

If you have access to the BMC or equivalent, such as iDRAC on Dell systems, you can get the information without rebooting the host:

### Step 2 - Verify the NFIT bus is available in the Kernel

If you have the `ndctl` utility installed, use it to determine whether the NFIT bus is available. If so, you should see output similar to the following:

```
# ndctl list --buses
[
  {
    "provider":"ACPI.NFIT",
    "dev":"ndbus0",
    "scrub_state":"idle"
  }
]
```

If ndctl returns no output, then this is the cause of the 'Non-functional' health status. See 'Step 3' to verify the nfit driver is loaded.

### Step 3 - Verify the 'nfit' driver is loaded

There are several drives that will be loaded by the Kernel depending on the operational mode of Persistent Memory.

The following shows the loaded drivers for a Linux operating system when persistent memory is in AppDirect mode:

```
# lsmod | egrep -i "nv|pmem"
dax_pmem               16384  0
dax_pmem_core          16384  1 dax_pmem
nd_pmem                24576  0
nd_btt                 28672  1 nd_pmem
nvme                   49152  0
nvme_core             110592  1 nvme
libnvdimm             192512  5 dax_pmem,dax_pmem_core,nd_btt,nd_pmem,nfit
```

Here's what to expect for a system in Memory Mode:

```
# lsmod | egrep -i "nv|pmem"
nvme                   49152  0
nvme_core             110592  1 nvme
libnvdimm             192512  1 nfit
```

If the 'nfit' driver is not shown, it is not loaded. Both ndctl and ipmctl use the nfit driver to communicate with the persistent memory through the BIOS. A failure to communicate with the BIOS or modules will result in a 'Non-functional' health state.

### Step 4 - Determine if the drivers are installed

For all Linux distros that support persistent memory, the drivers should be available and loadable. If you use a custom kernel, it's very likely the kernel configuration file disabled the required NVDIMM feature and the drivers were not built. Confirm that your Linux distribution has the necessary 'acpi', 'nfit', and \*pmem\* drivers installed.

Most Linux distros keep their drivers in `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers`. On Fedora, for example, the drivers are installed by default:

```
# ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/acpi/nfit
nfit.ko.xz

# cd /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers
$ find . -print |
 egrep -i "nvdimm|pmem|dax|acpi"
./nvdimm
./nvdimm/nd_pmem.ko.xz
./nvdimm/nd_e820.ko.xz
./nvdimm/libnvdimm.ko.xz
./nvdimm/nd_blk.ko.xz
./nvdimm/nd_btt.ko.xz
./dax
./dax/dax_hmem.ko.xz
./dax/device_dax.ko.xz
./dax/kmem.ko.xz
./dax/pmem
./dax/pmem/dax_pmem.ko.xz
./dax/pmem/dax_pmem_core.ko.xz
./acpi
./acpi/sbs.ko.xz
./acpi/sbshc.ko.xz
./acpi/apei
./acpi/apei/einj.ko.xz
./acpi/acpi_tad.ko.xz
./acpi/video.ko.xz
./acpi/acpi_configfs.ko.xz
./acpi/ec_sys.ko.xz
./acpi/custom_method.ko.xz
./acpi/acpi_ipmi.ko.xz
./acpi/nfit
./acpi/nfit/nfit.ko.xz
./acpi/acpi_pad.ko.xz
```

If the acpi, nfit, nvdimm, dax, and pmem directories are missing, the drivers are missing or were disabled when the kernel was built. This will result in communication issues to the BIOS and persistent memory modules, resulting in unexpected errors from ndctl and ipmctl.

The drivers are delivered as part of the Kernel package. On Fedora31, for example, we see the nfit driver is delivered by the kernel itself:

```
# dnf provides /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/acpi/nfit/nfit.ko.xz

### Step 5 - Determine if your kernel was configured to support persistent memory

See my previous post on '[How To Verify Linux Kernel Support for Persistent Memory](https://stevescargall.com/2020/02/11/how-to-verify-linux-kernel-support-for-persistent-memory/)'. The [NVDIMM Wiki on Kernel.org](https://nvdimm.wiki.kernel.org/) also has a section to help custom kernel developers.

Set up the correct kernel configuration options for PMEM and DAX in .config. To use huge pages for mmapped files, you'll need CONFIG\_FS\_DAX\_PMD selected, which is done automatically if you have the prerequisites marked below.

Options in make menuconfig:

- Device Drivers - NVDIMM (Non-Volatile Memory Device) Support
    - PMEM: Persistent memory block device support
    
    - BLK: Block data window (aperture) device support
    
    - BTT: Block Translation Table (atomic sector updates)

- Enable the block layer
    - Block device DAX support <not available in kernel-4.5 due to page cache issues>

- File systems
    - Direct Access (DAX) support

- Processor type and features
    - Support non-standard NVDIMMs and ADR protected memory <if using the memmap kernel parameter>
    
    - Transparent Hugepage Support <needed for huge pages>
    
    - Allow for memory hot-add
        
        - Allow for memory hot remove <needed for huge pages>
        
    
    - Device memory (pmem, HMM, etcâ€¦) hotplug support <needed for huge pages>

You can check what options were used to configure the Kernel using the config file that usually resides in the /boot file system. There are many more kernel options available than listed in the Wiki. For example, on Kernel 5.6.13, we have:
