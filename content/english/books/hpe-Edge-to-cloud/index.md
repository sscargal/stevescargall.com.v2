Workloads and data are moving to the edge, and the cloud is not so much a destination but an experience to be delivered wherever it is desired.

This book, based on the knowledge of 33 leading HPE experts, gives IT and business professionals an inside track to create the edge‐centric, cloud‐enabled, and data‐driven enterprise of the future. Each of the 19 chapters looks at a use case by outlining the issues and then delivers
HPE based solutions.
