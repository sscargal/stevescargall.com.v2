The CXL Consortium will be on-site at Supercomputing 2024 (SC24) to demonstrate how CXL technology solves memory bottlenecks for memory-intensive and memory-elastic workloads while also enhancing AI / ML workloads with expanded memory access. Our member companies are excited to showcase CXL solutions available in the market today capable of addressing performance gaps between compute and memory.
