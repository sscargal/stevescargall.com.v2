A huge ecosystem of vendors is working to make the CXL vision a reality, and the place to learn about the status of their progress is a CXL Forum event.  A cross-section of compute, storage, networking, system, and software vendors, as well as users, are represented at each event for a 360 degree of CXL technology and market development.

In addition to a full day of presentations, during breaks you will be able to check out live demonstrations of a Memory Viewer to see all the memory in a fabric, CXL Memory Pooling systems that replace swap-to-storage with shared memory, the Gismo (Global IO-free Shared Memory Object) software that replaces internode cluster traffic with shared memory, and a CXL Flight Simulator that allows developers to get started without CXL hardware.
