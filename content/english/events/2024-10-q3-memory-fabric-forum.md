Compute Express Link® (CXL®) is a new software protocol that runs on your server’s PCIe bus. It unlocks the power to pool, tier, and share memory in a data center fabric. The results will be vastly more memory capacity and lower cost due to higher utilization, things you will need to support memory-hungry generative AI apps in the enterprise.

Attend this Zoom webinar to receive an introduction from leading vendors designed specifically for enterprise IT pros.

You’ll learn about CXL solutions hitting the market in 2024 incorporating:

- Servers with CXL-compatible CPUs, GPUs, and DPUs
- CXL-compatible memory chips, PCIe cards, and E3.S modules
- External CXL memory arrays connected to servers with CXL switches
- Low-latency CXL optical port cards and cables
